	<h1>Hong Kong: China to pass 'patriot' electoral reforms</h1>
		<p>China is expected on Tuesday to finalise changes to Hong Kong's electoral rules, which critics say will tighten its control over the city. The aim of the changes is to ensure that only "patriotic" figures can run for positions of power. Critics warn it would mean the end of democracy in Hong Kong, keeping any opposition out of the city parliament. The move would mean that any prospective MPs would first be vetted for their loyalty to the mainland. Beijing first approved plans to change the way Hong Kong's elections work during the National People's Congress (NPC) earlier in March. The details are now being hammered out by Beijing's NPC Standing Committee, before they are added to the annexes of Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law.</p>
		<p>The plan is to expand Hong Kong's parliament, the Legislative Council (LegCo), from 70 to 90 seats. But most importantly, it envisages a system where LegCo candidates will be vetted before they can run, thus making it easier to bar any politician deemed critical of the mainland.</p>
		<p>Currently about half of LegCo's seats are directly voted for by the public, and some of those seats have gone to pro-democracy figures in the past. The other half is filled by smaller groups representing special interests such as business, banking and trade - sectors which are historically already pro-Beijing.</p>
