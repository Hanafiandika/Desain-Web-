	<h1>Indonesia fire: Massive blaze erupts at oil refinery</h1>
		<p>Firefighters in Indonesia are working to put out a massive fire that has broken out at one of the largest oil refineries in the country. The fire broke out at the Balongan refinery, run by state oil firm Pertamina, at 00:45 local time on Monday (17:45 GMT Sunday). At least five people are injured and around 950 residents have been evacuated to safety. A handful of people have been reported missing. The cause of the fire remains unclear. TV footage and videos on social media showed the fire still raging on Monday morning with a plume of smoke rising high above the refinery, located in West Java province.</p>
		<p>"We smelled a strong fuel scent first, so strong that my nose hurt, while we heard lightning strikes," one nearby resident told local news outlet Metro TV, according to a Reuters report. According to the regional disaster management agency, five people were being treated in hospital for serious burns with another 15 with minor burns.</p>
		<p>The Balongan Refinery is one of Indonesia's largest refineries and also one of its most crucial, as it feeds fuel and petrochemicals to the greater Jakarta area. Questions have now been raised on how this incident will affect plastics and chemicals businesses and factories, though Pertamina has told the public that "fuel delivery to the public is undisturbed and currently still ongoing". Already many are demanding answers on how such a disastrous incident could happen to a state-owned refinery. One politician, Kurtubi, pointed out in a TV interview that Balongan refinery, which has been in operation since 1994, is relatively new compared with other Pertamina refineries. Mr Kurtubi, who is a member of the House of Representatives' commission for energy affairs, also demanded an evaluation of the distances between oil refineries and residential zones. On social media, there were calls for a thorough investigation. "Was there sabotage or is this a genuine accident?" asked one Indonesian netizen. Others questioned whether standard operating procedure had been followed. "Otherwise, the person who caused this must be taken to court," said another netizen.</p>
